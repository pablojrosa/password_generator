The objective of this project is to create a website, running locally, that creates random passwords, helping you to increase your online security.

If you know a little, you will probably find that it is quite basic because it is my first web development job, but I will focuse on improving it as my habilities  increases.

I get inspired by [Nick Walter](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nick-walter/) who is the hoster of the greatest web development course on (O'Reilly)[Django 3 - Full Stack Websites with Python Web Development]. Also he's the owner of [zappycode](https://zappycode.com/) an amazing source of knowladge.

I hope you enjoy it!
